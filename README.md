## Chest X-Ray Analysis: Neural Network

Machine Learning Application: Diagnosing Pneumonia With Chest X-Ray Images

This program implements and trains a convolutional neural network model to predict whether there is pneumonia present in a chest x-ray picture 

The 'setupDirectories.py' program creates directories on the local computer and splits and renames the image files into approriate training and testing directories for model training and testing
